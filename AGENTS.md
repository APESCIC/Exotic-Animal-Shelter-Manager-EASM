# AGENTS.md

Instructions for Cursor agents working on **Exotic Animal Shelter Manager (EASM)**. Do not invent extra product constraints. This repo may be README-only until the Laravel scaffold lands.

## Product constraints

- Self-hosted PHP/MySQL app for ordinary web hosting. One Composer install step. One shelter per install.
- Stack: **Laravel + PHP 8 + MySQL/MariaDB**.
- No Cloudron OIDC/staff login in v0.1. Local admin on generic hosting must work on day one. Do **not** copy MyAPES-Account Cloudron auth.
- Do **not** fork Animal Shelter Manager (ASM / [sheltermanager.com](https://sheltermanager.com)). Use it as a feature baseline only.
- Exotic species stay free-text. Animal records get a **primary photo** plus enclosure/CITES/DWA on #12 (do not wait for v0.3 media / #18 for the primary photo).
- Animal control (#24) is municipal ASM; it must **not** block v1.0.0.
- UK locale/timezone defaults.

## Implement order

Finish a milestone before starting the next.

**App Developer owns [#9](https://github.com/APESCIC/Exotic-Animal-Shelter-Manager-EASM/issues/9)** (Laravel + PHP 8 + MySQL scaffold). Other Cursor runs must not open a second scaffold PR, touch #9, or start a scaffold branch.

1. #27 backup/security/first production install pack

Plan epic is #1 (unmiled).

## Local development (Windows)

Prefer **Laragon** for preview and CLI. See README “Local development” and `.cursor/rules/local-dev.mdc`.

- Source `scripts/local/use-laragon.ps1` before `php` / `composer` / tests.
- Preview: **http://easm.test** (Apache document root `public/`). Do not start `php artisan serve` when Laragon can serve the app.
- Interactive DB: Laragon MySQL on `127.0.0.1`. Do not use Docker hostnames (e.g. `easm-mysql`) for local smoke.
- Do **not** run Pint / `composer format` / `composer lint` mid-work. Lint once only in the ship-gate pre-commit verification block.

## Ship-gate

Work starts and finishes from a Cursor agent request. Follow `.cursor/rules/ship-gate.mdc` and `.cursor/skills/ship-gate/SKILL.md`:

1. When a slice is ready, run the **pre-commit verification** (full `composer test`, one `composer lint`, Laragon UI smoke when HTTP was touched). On failure, fix or stop — do **not** present the commit gate.
2. Only after verification passes, present the **commit gate** (never commit silently).
3. Open/update the PR; watch CI until green; present the **merge gate**.
4. After merge on `main`, present the **GitHub Release gate** only as an opt-in — create a release when the operator decides, never silently.
5. **No deploy gate.** Shelters download/clone and install on their own hosting (Composer + `/install`). Do not invent Cloudron or CI deploy steps.

## GitHub issues

- Search **this repo** for duplicates. Never open issues in other repos.
- Prefer `area:` labels if they exist. Do not invent `type:` or `priority:` labels.
- Branch `cursor/{feature|fix|chore}/<issue-number>-<slug>`. Open PRs with `Fixes #<n>`.
- Assignee: `bmurphy-apescic` unless another owner is named.
